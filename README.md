# 🚀 AI Dungeon Crawler
A Groq-powered, Monad-integrated browser game where you explore, loot, and evolve in an AI-generated world.

# 📌 Problem Statement
## Problem D – Using Monad as well as other partner technologies

## Build an AI dungeon crawler where Groq powers the narrative generation and Monad handles item minting and progress tracking.

# 🎯 Objective
This project creates a real-time, procedurally narrated dungeon crawler using Groq for AI story generation and Monad to mint items and track player progress on-chain.
It serves indie devs, gamers, and blockchain explorers who want rich, persistent, story-driven gameplay.

# 🧠 Team & Approach
## Team Name:
Inferno571

## Team Members:
Solo Hacker: inferno571 (Dev / Designer / Builder)

Your Approach:

Chose this problem to combine AI storytelling + smart contract logic

Challenges: merging real-time Groq responses with player input + blockchain UX

Breakthrough: structuring the game loop to allow dynamic Groq response injection and minting flow via Monad smart contracts

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Core Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: None (Static app with smart contract + API calls)

Database: Monad blockchain (for progress & minting)

APIs: Groq API (for narrative generation)

Sponsor Technologies Used:

✅ Groq: Powers the live narration and story branching system based on player actions

✅ Monad: Used to mint items (NFT-style) and save player runs on-chain



# ✨ Key Features
✅ Groq-driven story generation based on your actions
✅ Sound effects + keyboard-based movement & combat
✅ Item minting using Monad smart contract
✅ On-chain tracking of dungeon runs

A browser-based, DOOM-themed dungeon crawler that combines **on-chain smart contracts** (Monad testnet) with **AI-generated narrative** (Groq).

> ⚠️ No real money, no tokens, no NFTs — just brutal gameplay and AI flavor.
